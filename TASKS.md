## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***

In order to calculate the forecasting number of available workers, we have compute different matrixes. The first one (D) is based on historical data from the beginning of the year 2020. The second one (M) is composed on historical data from the end of the year 2020. We have used data from our company in the matrix b. We are 2 managers, 1 engineers and 1 operator at the beginning of2021. 

So finally, once the software has compute its operations, we have get that the prediction for the end of the year 2021 is; 1 manager, 1 engineers and 2 operators. 

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***

In order to calculate the forecasting number of needed workers, we have to follow two steps. To start with, we have compute two matrixes ( X & Y). We use the given data to complet the matrixes and the software give us the result for beta (0.125), s1 (3.083), s2 (11.958) and s3 (4,542). To continue with the prediction, we multiply two matrixes (step 2). The first one is formed with the expected unemployment rate for the different occupations; and the second one is a colum vector with the data computed before (beta, s1, s2 and s3).

After the computations, we obtain the following expected needed of workers: 4 managers (4.33), 12 engineers (12.458) and 7 operators (7.042).

To finish with this we want to compare the forecasting needed of workers and the forecasting available workers. There are going to be a surplus of 3 managers, 11 engineers and 5 operators.
